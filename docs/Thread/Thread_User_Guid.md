# Thread User Guide

This document provides an overview of the Thread SDK architecture and points you to usage examples for different Thread device roles:

* [`ot-cli-ftd`](../../examples/thread/ot-cli-ftd): Full Thread Device
* [`ot-cli-mtd`](../../examples/thread/ot-cli-mtd-sleep): Minimal Thread Device
* [`ot-cli-ncp`](../../examples/thread/ot-cli-ncp): Network Co-Processor

## üìò What is Thread?

[Thread](https://openthread.io/) is a low-power, secure, and IPv6-based wireless mesh networking protocol for IoT and smart home applications. It supports self-healing mesh topology, low-latency communication, and is designed to work reliably even in harsh RF environments.

## üß± SDK Architecture Overview

The Thread SDK typically contains the following example applications under `examples/thread/`:

```
examples/thread/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ot-cli-ftd/   # Full Thread Device example
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ot-cli-mtd/   # Minimal Thread Device example
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ot-cli-ncp/   # Network Co-Processor example
```

### Thread Device Types

| Type | Description                                                         | Suitable For                              |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| FTD  | Full Thread Device. Can become Leader, Router, or Child. Always-on. | Mains-powered, always-connected devices   |
| MTD  | Minimal Thread Device. Can only be a Child. Sleep-capable.          | Low-power, battery devices                |
| NCP  | Network Co-Processor. Controlled by external host.                  | Host/NCP architecture like Linux gateways |

## üîç ot-cli-ftd

`ot-cli-ftd` is a Full Thread Device example that can operate as a Leader, Router, or Child. It is always on and suitable for devices that need to maintain full mesh routing capabilities.

üìÑ Full usage guide: `examples/thread/ot-cli-ftd/README.md`

**Note:**

* Suitable for use as the network's root or routing node.
* Not suitable for low-power devices.

---

## üí• ot-cli-mtd

`ot-cli-mtd` is a Minimal Thread Device example. MTDs are designed for low-power, battery-operated devices and only function as Child nodes.

üìÑ Full usage guide: `examples/thread/ot-cli-mtd-sleep/README.md`

**Note:**

* Use `ot pollperiod` to configure polling interval.
* MTD cannot route traffic and relies on FTD routers.

---

## üîå ot-cli-ncp

`ot-cli-ncp` is a Network Co-Processor example used when the Thread stack runs on a separate MCU (NCP), controlled by a host system via the Spinel protocol.

üìÑ Full usage guide: `examples/thread/ot-cli-ncp/README.md`

**Note:**

* Use tools like `wpantund` or `pyspinel` on the host to communicate with NCP.
* Ensure UART/SPI is properly configured between host and NCP.
